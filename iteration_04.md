# Fourth iteration - Making money

The machine is becoming popular in the office. The management is eager to have daily reports of what is sold and when.

# Use cases
* I want to be able to print a report anytime that contains: how many of each drink was sold and the total amount of money earned so far.

## Implementation details
For the reporting, you can have a repository of data with a simple data structure in memory. A simple reporting can be done by printing to the console. Of course all of that should be tested before it is written, but you know that already, don't you ? ;)

##
[Previous iteration](iteration_03.md)
Nice you've gone this far, can you handle the [final](iteration_05.md) assignment ?
